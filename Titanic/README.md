Hi everyone,
This is my first Kaggle and ML problem. I am writing this with the intent of sharing my journey and attempts to my first ML Problem.This solution scored 0.78708 on Kaggle. Some tuning of the model yielded my highest score of 0.79904 but unfortunately I didn't keep track of that. :| <br>
Any suggestions to improve the method are welcome.
