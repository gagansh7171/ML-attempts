In case you want to attempt yourself or compare my model to yours -
1. Training data has been divided into final_data_train_1 and final_data_train_2. Concat them along rows (axis = 0).
2. Rename ipynb_checkpoints to <b>.ipynb_checkpoints</b>
3. Exploratory data analysis is done in explore.ipynb .
4. Model selection an testing is done in algo.ipynb .
